# synology_iscsilun: The Synology iSCSI LUN MIB can list all loaded LUNs and show their running information.
#                    If a LUN has been created but not loaded (e.g. when linked to a target), it will not appear in this list.
#                    The throughput value may be over int32 range, so we use two i to record it
